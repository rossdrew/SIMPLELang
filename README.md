### Understanding Computation

These are excercises from [Understanding Computation](https://computationbook.com/) by Tom Stuart of O'REILLY.  Written in Kotlin instead of Ruby.

The full excercises in Ruby can be found on the books [GitHub](https://github.com/tomstuart/computationbook) page.

#### Testing

I'm playing with some Kotlin unit testing

##### kotlin.test

Simple, works, bit long-winded. No property or data-driven tests that I can see

##### Kotest

Expressive, seem to have property based testing. Bit more boilerplate to get tests running, need a plugin to run individually through IntelliJ.
